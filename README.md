# CS428_Project1
This is my repository for Project 1 in CS 428.

- To build the Unity project, you need to use Unity version 2019.4.28f1 and the Unity package for Vuforia version 9.8.
- You must also have build support for Android on Unity and USB Debugging enabled on your Android device if you wish to run the app on Android.
- When building this project for Android, make sure that you have switched platforms by clicking the "Switch Platform" button in File/Build Settings and that the minimum API level is Android 4.4 Kitkat (API Level 19) in Edit/Project Settings/Player/Other Settings.
- From there, you can connect your Android device to your computer, make sure Unity has it selected, and finally build and run the project.
- Once finished, the apk will be saved to your computer and device, and the app will automatically run on your device.
